# Virtualmind Tests

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e92f3e37-621c-4adc-aee6-7d7b67634411/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/virtualmind/deploys)

This project was developed to demonstrate as a simple and totally functional application in React (front-end) and Node (back-end).  It was applied some cool concepts on the backend like using Rest API (Representational State Transfer API), Database Mock, reading text files on the server, and the use of Promise and Async/Await. On the front-end it was also used several concepts such as React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback...) and custom hooks (useFetch), creating independent components. The site was styled with styled-components (css-in-js) and external css. Also, the Rest API was deployed at Heroku server and the Web Application was deployed at Netlify Server. The API can be accessed at https://virtualmind-api.herokuapp.com end-point, and the web application can be accessed at https://virtualmind.apfjuliano.com.br.
